# The JavaScript Fundamental Projects Suite AKA "The Basics"

## Intro / Purpose

Hi, I’m Jon, an aspiring web developer from Denver, Colorado. At the time of writing this, I’m in the process of solidifying the fundamentals of web development before taking on more advanced projects. I realized that the majority of the “starter projects” suggested online are variations of the same 10-20 apps. With the intention of building my portfolio, I thought a unique way to add these projects to my portfolio (without filling it entirely with junk projects) would be to combine them all into a single, cohesive app called "The JavaScript Fundamental Projects Suite."

## Scope

The "Fundamental Projects Suite" will include the following basic tools:

- Calculator
- Calendar
- Clock
- Contacts
- Currency-Con
- News Feed
- Recipe
- Stop-Watch & Timer
- To-Do-List
- Notes
- Weather
- Snake Game

The app will have a main menu to navigate between these tools, and all elements will be styled consistently for a cohesive look. The goal is to combine these fundamental projects into one convenient app.

## Research

For this project, I relied on various resources to guide me:

- London App Brewery's 2024 Complete Front-End Web Development Bootcamp
- YouTube: Tutorials and guides to understand specific features and techniques
- Stack Overflow: Aids in finding solutions to coding issues and learning best practices
- LLMs: I use ChatGPT as an educational resource, seeking help and clarification on various aspects of the project as needed, but limited code generation to tasks I’m confident in writing and fixing myself

## Planning

For the "Fundamental Projects Suite", my planning process included the following steps:

1. **Define Elements**: Identify the basic tools to include: a clock, calendar, to-do list, notes, currency converter, weather app, contact list, recipe book, and more.
2. **Set Goals**: Establish the main goal of combining multiple basic projects into one cohesive app.
3. **Create Timeline**: Develop a rough timeline for designing, coding, testing, and deploying the app.
4. **Design Mockups**: Use the AI designs to sketch simple wireframes in Figma to ensure a consistent look.
5. **Organize Files**: Set up the project structure with separate files for each component and shared resources like CSS and JavaScript.

## Design / Prototyping

- **Simplified Wireframes**: Created wireframes for the app using Figma. These basic wireframes outline the layout and structure for each component. The goal is to display continuity between apps and document the design process.

## Development

### Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple components, each representing one of the fundamental projects. The main directories include:

- **Source Files**
- **Components**
- **Audio**
- **Images**

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring the main content of the application
- **CSS3**: Styling the application
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core functionality and interactivity of the tools
- **Figma**: Design and prototyping tool for wireframes

### Development Process

1. **Setup and Initialization**:
   - Set up the project structure with a focus on modularity.
2. **Component Development**:
   - Developed each tool as a separate JavaScript module to ensure modularity and reusability.
   - Created common components (e.g., Header, Footer, Navigation) for a cohesive look and feel across all tools.
3. **Styling**:
   - Global styles are defined in a main CSS file to maintain consistency.
   - Used BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for naming CSS classes to keep the styles modular and maintainable.
4. **Functionality**:
   - Implemented the core functionality for each tool using vanilla JavaScript.
   - Managed state and interactions using JavaScript functions and event listeners.
   - Added form validation and error handling where necessary.
5. **Integration**:
   - Integrated all components into a single-page application (SPA) using vanilla JavaScript for navigation.
   - Created a main menu component to navigate between tools.
   - Ensured seamless interaction between components and a smooth user experience.
6. **Testing**:
   - Conducted unit tests using Jasmine to verify the functionality of individual components.
   - Performed integration testing to ensure all components work together as expected.
7. **Optimization**:
   - Prompted LLMs (GPT-4 and Claude) with current code and asked for a professional audit.
   - Refactored CSS to use more global styles instead of independent definitions.
   - Fixed naming schemes for continuity.
   - Added annotations.
8. **Deployment**:
   - Due to the nature of the project being for personal education (and some of the APIs requiring payment), I am leaving it as a GitHub repository instead of deploying it to Netlify.

## Conclusion

This project has been a valuable refresher after taking a year off post-bootcamp. It feels rewarding to write code again and regain some confidence in my abilities.

However, I recognize the need for professional mentorship to refine my workflow and avoid developing bad habits. This project was approached with the same seriousness as a professional assignment, aiming to bridge the gap in my workflow knowledge using all available resources.

Although there’s always room for adding more functionality and modernizing the design, my current priority is to deepen my understanding of frameworks and take on more complex projects. Balancing a full-time retail job, I need to strategically focus my learning efforts to transition into a career in web development.

Thank you for taking the time to review this project. I hope you find value in my journey and experiences shared here. I look forward to showcasing more impressive projects in the future!
